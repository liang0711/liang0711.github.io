```Goal```: Assessing the impact of various drugs on patients using the Open FDA Database


#### In recent years, researchers have found significant differences among age and gender groups in the ways they respond to and metabolize drugs, and experience side effects. 
To be more specific, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) remain a challenge in modern healthcare field. In this task project, we will be using FDA’s Adverse Drug Events Database to explore the side effects
and ADRs among the global FDA-approved drugs. 

We aim to identify major adverse reactions, particularly gender-based severe outcomes, enhancing medication safety. Extracting data from the FDA API, we focus on 2017-2022. Our approach includes crafting machine learning models, like tree models, to predict adverse reaction severity using patient data and drug types. By comparing metrics, we select the most accurate model.
