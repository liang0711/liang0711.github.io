#### Summary: 

The project's techniques have facilitated real-time data retrieval, storage, and the potential for future machine learning analysis, thereby unveiling new avenues for exploration and insights. 

- Business Outline: 
In the post-pandemic era, the surging demand for travel has prompted individuals to prioritize budget-conscious choices, particularly concerning accommodation expenses. To cater to these preferences, some chain hotels such as Hyatt can leverage the project's insights to gauge the overarching market trends and furnish customers with accurate cost estimates to boost their preference and trust. 

This initiative equips businesses to monitor dynamic price shifts, enabling them to align their rates for customers with prevailing market trends in real time, during high-demand periods. Meanwhile, accumulated historical data information can be meaningful for Data Analytic Department to perform modeling and future sophsciticated analysis.
